// Question 1: How can you verify that "BRUTUS" was added to the beginning of the array?
// Question 1A You can check if Brutus was added to the beginning by inputting guests[0]

// step 2: A herald announced the arrival of "AUGUSTUS" and "LUCIA". Add them to the end of the guest list.
guests.push("AUGUSTUS", "LUCIA");


// step 3: Caesar is curious. He wants to know if "SPARTACUS" has been invited. Check if he's on the list and find out at which position.

// Question 2: What would value of spartacusindex be if "SPARTACUS" wasn't invited?
